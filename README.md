#  Building Energy Consumption and CO2 Emissions Modelling with Data Leakage Consideration

This project aims to develop accurate models for predicting building energy consumption and CO2 emissions while addressing the challenge of data leakage. The project consists of three notebooks: an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) notebook, a Building Energy Consumption Modelling notebook, and a Building CO2 Emissions Modelling notebook.

The EDA notebook focuses on exploring and understanding the dataset. It conducts comprehensive data analysis to identify key patterns and insights related to building energy consumption and CO2 emissions. By gaining a deeper understanding of the data, it provides valuable insights for subsequent modeling steps.

The Building Energy Consumption Modelling notebook is dedicated to developing a robust model for predicting building energy consumption. Leveraging advanced techniques and algorithms, it utilizes the dataset to train and optimize the model. The notebook also takes into account the potential pitfalls of data leakage and implements strategies to mitigate its impact on model performance.

Similarly, the Building CO2 Emissions Modelling notebook focuses on constructing an accurate model for predicting building CO2 emissions. It employs appropriate methodologies and approaches to effectively capture the relationship between different variables and CO2 emissions. Data leakage prevention techniques are incorporated to ensure reliable and meaningful predictions.

One of the key aspects of this project is the consideration of data leakage. Data leakage occurs when information from the future (not available during the actual prediction) is inadvertently included in the model training process, leading to overly optimistic results. To address this, the project employs techniques such as cross-validation and feature engineering to ensure that the models are robust and reliable.

The results and insights obtained from the models provide valuable information for understanding building energy consumption patterns and CO2 emissions drivers. Performance metrics such as RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error) and R-squared are used to evaluate the models' accuracy. Additionally, the project identifies important factors influencing energy consumption and CO2 emissions, contributing to informed decision-making in energy efficiency and sustainability initiatives.

To enhance the project's presentation, a visually appealing diapositive is included, summarizing the key steps of the project. Graphs, charts, and diagrams are utilized to showcase the EDA process, modeling techniques, and leakage mitigation strategies. This helps communicate the project's success and highlights the significance of considering data leakage in building energy consumption and CO2 emissions modeling.

The project's code and related resources can be found on GitHub, providing a comprehensive reference for replication, further development, and collaboration. Feedback and contributions from the community are highly welcomed to improve the project's methodology and expand its applications.
